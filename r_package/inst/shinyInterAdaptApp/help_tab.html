<h4> About <i>interAdapt</i> </h4>

<p><i> A tool created by Aaron Fisher, Harris Jaffee, and Michael Rosenblum </i></p>
</br>

<p>
<i>interAdapt</i> is designed to aid statisticians and clinical investigators in planning randomized trials. It can be used to determine whether certain adaptive designs offer tangible benefits compared to standard designs, in the context of investigators’ specific trial goals and constraints. Specifically, interAdapt compares the performance of trial designs with adaptive enrollment criteria to that of standard (non-adaptive) group sequential designs. Performance is evaluated in terms of power, expected trial duration, and expected sample size. Users can work interactively in the R console or with a user friendly shiny application that requires no programming experience. The shiny application contains several features for saving and re-loading the results of intermediate steps of the analysis. For example, the application allows users to save the results of the performance comparison as a tabular csv-file or as a printable, html-based report.

<p>
<i>interAdapt</i> is designed to work in the following open-source web browsers: <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/' target="_blank">Firefox</a> or <a href='https://www.google.com/chrome' target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>.
 However, it may also work in Safari and Internet Explorer, depending on the version.

Online documentation and instructions for using <i>interAdapt</i> are available <a href="https://rawgithub.com/aaronjfisher/interAdapt/master/About_interAdapt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The  documentation organized in the following sections:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to the software</li>
<li>Section 1: Formal definition of the problem addressed by these trials -- this is needed in order to understand the notation in <i>interAdapt</i>’s user interface</li>
<li>Section 2: Overview of the currently available comparable software</li> 
<li>Section 3: How to install <i>interAdapt</i> locally or access <i>interAdapt</i> online</li> 
<li>Section 4: Explanation of the inputs & ouputs available in <i>interAdapt</i></li>
<li>Section 5: Example of using <i>interAdapt</i> to design a trial</li>
</ul>

<p>
To experiment with <i>interAdapt</i>, select <i>Performance</i> using the radio button above (which displays power curves for adaptive and standard designs). Try moving one or more sliders on the left, and then click the <i>Apply</i> button on the top left. After about 5 seconds, the power curves will update to reflect design performance under these new parameter settings.
