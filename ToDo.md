#To Do


* Email JSS editors, say we want the GPL-2 License

## Stuff we could do if we want to (after submitting)
* clean up comments in latex file
* Clean up the development repo, possibly rename it.

## Whenever we update the code
* See notes at the top of the latex file about how to update all the stuff. There are also notes in the glimmer files folder, about how the RStudio webserver version should differ from the local version people can install. The version control files are in the base dir of the interAdapt repo, as is the About_interAdapt documentation.
* Be sure to adjust knitr Rmd files. Update interAdapt repo, and spark files.
