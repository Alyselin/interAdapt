#To Do

## Things to talk about
* All set for now

## For Michael to do


#### Things to do now
* first pull changes from github
* Write Acknowledgements section, talking about things like grants?
* Add some comments to the code, above each function maybe? The JSS people say they the code to be commented and readable.
*(Done) Update the decision boundaries in the code to be proportional inverse of n_k/sum(n_k), not to the stage number (because number of patients enrolled varies). Keep sum n_k so that the proportionality constants are on a smaller scale. 
*(Done) Adjust boxTable and sliderTable initial values -- change label to be "Per stage sample size for stages where only sub-population 1 is enrolled" instead of "sub-population 2". 
*(Done) Name app 
*(Done) Answer email questions about range of subpop2 trt effect 
*(Done) Edit table functions in Designs section
*(Done) If you have time, can you fix the plot functions also, for plotting the descision boundaries? (match indexing calls of table to the new rownames of the tables)
*(Done) Write ADDPLAN section 

 

#### Things to do after Aaron sends back a draft
* read over final draft.
* Make adjustments where you see "!!!" in the comments.






## For Aaron to do
* (Done) Ask Jeff what we should use for the license  - He says GPL-2
* (Done) Make final links and set everything up 
* (After questions about sample size & boundaries) Read over paper again 
    * Need to ask Michael about the applied analysis section (see !!!! marks in tex file)
* (After Michael reads over final draft) adjust knitr Rmd files. 
* Update github and spark interAdapt files.
* Add user tracking to spark repo (can do after we submit paper)
