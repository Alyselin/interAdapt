#To Do


## For Michael to do
* first pull changes from github
* Read over new JSS paper draft, with special attention to the places where %!!! is in the comments. If you have time to edit the tex file directly that would be awesome!

## For Aaron to do
* Add comments to server.r and ui.r
* (After Michael reads over final draft) adjust knitr Rmd files. Update interAdapt repo, and spark files. 
* Add user tracking to spark repo (can do after we submit paper)
* Email JSS editors, say we want the GPL-2 License
