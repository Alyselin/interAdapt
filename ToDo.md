#To Do

## Things to talk about
* All set for now

## For Michael to do


#### Things to do now
* first pull changes from github
* Update the decision boundaries in the code to be proportional inverse of n_k/sum(n_k), not to the stage number (because number of patients enrolled varies). Keep sum n_k so that the proportionality constants are on a smaller scale.
* Adjust boxTable and sliderTable initial values -- change label to be "Per stage sample size for stages where only sub-population 1 is enrolled" instead of "sub-population 2".
* Name app (check!)
* Answer email questions about range of subpop2 trt effect
* Edit table functions in Designs section
* If you have time, can you fix the plot functions also, for plotting the descision boundaries? (match indexing calls of table to the new rownames of the tables)
* Write Acknowledgements section (grants?)
* Write ADDPLAN section (check!)
* Add comments to code, above each function maybe? The JSS people say they the code to be commented and readable.
 

#### Things to do after Aaron sends back a draft
* read over final draft.
* Make adjustments where you see "!!!" in the comments.






## For Aaron to do
* Ask Jeff what we should use for the license (Check!) - He says GPL-2
* Make final links and set everything up (Check!)
* (After questions about sample size & boundaries) Read over paper again (Check!)
    * Still waiting on questions about range of trt effect in subpop2. Also need to ask Michael about the applied analysis section (see !!!! marks in tex file)
* (After Michael reads over final draft) adjust knitr Rmd files. 
* Update github and spark interAdapt files.
* Add user tracking to spark repo (can do after we submit paper)
